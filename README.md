# Project Organo

In this project, the intention was to create a new feature of a new organo team. The organo aims to organize teams both for games and for work teams. This project was intended to teach more about React and how it sees exactly what it needs to change in the DOM so that it doesn't weigh so much and becomes more performant. In addition to the difference between the DOM and virtual DOM.
